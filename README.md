# PluginImage2Maps

Small plugin to load an image from a file/URL and render it as Minecraft maps to place it in your world.
Inspired by a YouTube video and added a lot of feature such as:
- Single map item placeholder with preview to not carry every part of the maps in your inventory
- Automatically place all maps correctly when you right-click on a block with the preview item
- Select the background color if the image has a transparent background
- ...

# Usage:
Import a map: /map < id > < url/path > [ background color ]

Get back the preview item of an imported map: /getmap < id >

Made for Spigot 1.8
